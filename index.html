                <p class="text-muted text-left">Punjabis are mainly divided into two communities: Khatris and Jats. They've been involved in agriculture for a long time now. But now, trade and commerce have also opened up in the state. A large population still follows the joint family system which has now turned out to be unique. The feeling of togetherness can be easily felt here as they promise to be with each other in moments of sadness and happiness.

                    Punjabis are very particular about their traditions and relations. Every festival or ceremony have predefined rituals which are strictly followed. May it be birth or wedding, hair cutting or a funeral, the adherence to rituals is a must which according to them strengthens a relation and displays a proper social cordiality.</p>
